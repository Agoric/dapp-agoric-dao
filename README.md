# Agoric Dapp Starter: Agoric Basics

This is a basic Agoric Dapp that contains three smart contracts `postal-service`, `sell-concert-tickets`, and `swaparoo` demonstrating different scenarios which can be implemented easily using Agoric SDK. There is also a UI for `sell-concert-tickets` contract that a user can use to buy three different types of concert tickets and pay through a wallet extension in the browser. 

## Getting started

Make sure all the required dependecies are already installed (including node, nvm, docker, Keplr, and that your node version is set to `18.x.x` by running `nvm use 18.20.2`. See [a tutorial here](https://docs.agoric.com/guides/getting-started/) on how to install these dependecies.). Here are the steps to run `dapp-agoric-basics`: 
- run `yarn install` in the `agoric-basics` directory, to install dependencies of the Dapp.
- run `yarn start:docker` to start Agoric blockchain from the container.
- run `yarn docker:logs` to to make sure blocks are being produced by viewing the Docker logs; once your logs resemble the following, stop the logs by pressing `ctrl+c`.
